\subsection*{Description}

{\bfseries Gray\+Bat} is a C++ library that presents a graph-\/based communication approach, which enables a mapping of algorithms to communication patterns and further a mapping of these communication patterns to varying hardware architectures. Therefore, a flexible and configurable communication approach for parallel and distributed applications. These mappings are established as an intermediate layer between an application and communication libraries and are dynamically adptable during run-\/time.

An application supported by Gray\+Bat can be created with the following steps\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Decide on how fine grain the application domain should be decomposed
\item Model communication pattern of subdomains as a graph
\item Choose mapping of graph vertices to peers
\item Choose hardware to run the application on
\end{DoxyEnumerate}



The \hyperlink{cage}{communication and graph environment} (cage) is the central class of Gray\+Bat. The cage provides both communication and graph operations to enable communication based on graphs and is a good point to {\bfseries get started}. Otherwise consider the \hyperlink{gol}{Game of Life} example simulation which provides a full demonstration of utilizing Gray\+Bat.
